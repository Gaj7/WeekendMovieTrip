# Weekend Movie Trip

## EECS 731: Introduction to Data Science, project 3.

In this project, I apply the Mean Shift clustering model to the MovieLens dataset to cluster movies, with the idea of providing a basis for a movie recommendation system. See the "Weeken Movie Trip" notebook for my work and documentation.

If you are running the notebook locally, refer to `requirements.md` for a list of prerequisite python packages.
